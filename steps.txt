Define the Bookstore class, which will contain the main method and initialize the necessary data structures, such as a delivery box, sections, assistants, and customers.

Create a Delivery class to represent a delivery of books, which will contain a list of books (10 books, with a random number for each section).

Create an Assistant class to represent an assistant who can take books from the delivery box and stock them in their respective sections. Assistants will be implemented as threads.

Create a Customer class to represent a customer who can buy books from the sections. Customers will be implemented as threads.

In the Bookstore class, use a while loop to simulate the operation of the bookstore. In each iteration, calculate the probability that a delivery of books will arrive and, if so, create a new Delivery object and put it in the delivery box.

Create a synchronized method for the delivery box to allow assistants to take books from the box.

Create a synchronized method for each section to allow assistants to stock books in the section and customers to buy books from the section.

Implement the Assistant class by creating a run() method that continually takes books from the delivery box and stocks them in their respective sections. If an assistant is carrying books to multiple sections, they will wait for other assistants to finish stocking before moving on.

Implement the Customer class by creating a run() method that continually looks for available books to buy from the sections. If a section is empty, the customer will wait for a book to become available.

Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, conditions) to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.

Test the system for different scenarios, such as different arrival and buying rates, different numbers of assistants and sections, and different seed values for the random function.

Add comments and annotations to the code to improve its readability and maintainability.
